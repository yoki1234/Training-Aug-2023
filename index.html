            To create a toggle switch, we will use HTML and CSS. If you want to add a more attractive toggle switch then
            you
            can add sliding animation, bouncing effect, etc. In this article, we will divide the whole thing into two
            different sections structure creating and designing the structure.

            Creating Structure: In this section, we will just create a basic structure for the toggle button. Here all
            we
            need to put a checkbox and a label to create in an HTML document like below. We can do that by using the
            HTML
            label tag and HTML input type = checkbox.

            HTML code: The HTML code is used to create a structure of toggle switch. Since it does not contain CSS so it
            is
            just a simple structure. We will use some CSS property to make it attractive responsive.
